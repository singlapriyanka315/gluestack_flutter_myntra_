# Myntra Clone Web Screens Project

This project is a partial clone of some screens from the Myntra web application, implemented using Flutter for web. It aims to recreate the UI of Myntra with an emphasis on clean, reusable, and flexible components, utilizing the [gluestack](https://pub.dev/packages/gluestack) Flutter package instead of Flutter's built-in Material components.

## Overview

The Myntra Clone Web Screens project provides an alternative UI implementation of select screens from the Myntra web application. By avoiding Flutter's built-in Material components, this project offers more design flexibility and a tailored look and feel closely aligned with the original Myntra app. 

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: Framework for creating natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Gluestack**: A package for creating custom components in Flutter, allowing for higher levels of customization and design flexibility.

## Features

- **Custom-designed UI components** based on Gluestack to resemble Myntra's web screens.
- **Material-free approach** to UI development for more control over the design and functionality.
- **Reusable, composable components** built entirely from scratch.

## Why Gluestack?

`Gluestack` is a Flutter package designed for creating UI components with a focus on flexibility and customizability. Unlike Flutter's Material library, which enforces Material Design standards, Gluestack enables developers to create their own component styles and functionalities from scratch. This makes it ideal for projects that need to replicate unique designs without the constraints of Material Design.

## Benefits of Avoiding Material Components

Flutter’s Material components follow Google’s Material Design standards, which can sometimes restrict customization. By not using Material components in this project, we gain several important advantages:

1. **Greater Design Flexibility**: Material widgets come with predefined styles and behaviors. Avoiding them gives us complete freedom to style each element as needed to closely replicate Myntra's unique design.

2. **Closer Brand Alignment**: Many apps, including Myntra, follow distinct branding guidelines that don’t always match Material Design. Custom components allow us to design a user experience that reflects Myntra’s brand identity rather than adapting to predefined Material styles.

3. **Reduced Package Size**: Without Material dependencies, the app’s package size can be reduced, potentially improving load times, especially important for web environments.

4. **Custom Interactions and Animations**: Material widgets come with built-in animations suited to Material Design but may feel out of place in a non-Material app. Building our components from scratch allows us to create interactions and animations that are more in line with Myntra’s design language.

5. **Consistency Across Platforms**: Material components are designed primarily for mobile, and adapting them for web can be challenging. Gluestack components ensure consistent behavior and appearance across all platforms, providing a seamless experience.

6. **Reusability in Non-Material Projects**: The custom components developed here are highly reusable for future projects that also need non-Material styling, enhancing productivity and scalability.

In summary, avoiding Material components allows us to create a custom, brand-aligned, and efficient UI that closely replicates Myntra’s unique web experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: Ensure you have Flutter installed. You can download it [here](https://pub.dev/packages/gluestack_ui).
- **Gluestack Package**: This project relies on Gluestack, so make sure to add it to your `pubspec.yaml`.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/singlapriyanka315/gluestack_flutter_myntra_.git
   cd gluestack_flutter_myntra_
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run the project on a web server:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```
